# Sorting_algos_visualizer
[See here](https://ankit253.github.io/Sorting_algos_visualizer/)
<br/>
Creating a simple visualizer for different sorting techniques. For eg.
<br/>
1. Selection sort<br/>
2. Bubble sort<br/>
3. Insertion sort<br/>
4. merge sort<br/>
5. Quick Sort<br/>
6. Heap sort<br/>

This is built using HTML, CSS and Java script.<br/>
Different files are made for different sorting algorithms, so that if at any point modification is needed can be done easily.<br/>
Different colurs are used while visualizating, green means that part is sorted, yellow for comparision, red for current element and blue is unsorted part.<br/>
